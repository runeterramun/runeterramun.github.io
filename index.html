<h1>Mysterious Fires Plague Demacian Coast</h1>
<h2>League officials investigating possibility of rogue magic use </h2>
<div align="justify">
<div class="article_block_50 left">
<div class="reporter_box"><span class="reported_by">Henril Dreving</span> <span class="reported_from"> reporting from Andras</span></div><img class="inline_image" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;" src="./JOJ TEMPLATE_files/portrait_Henril1.jpg" alt="">

<p>A slew of fires cropped up along the western coast of Valoran this 
week, beginning at the small Demacian coastal settlement of Andras and 
spreading south into the forests of the Great Barrier. While Demacian 
forces assist in containment of these mysterious fires, the Institute of
 War has dispatched a group of officials to oversee the proceedings on 
suspicion of unauthorized use of magic. </p>
<p>Settlers of Andras, a quiet settlement situated on a small bluff 
overlooking the Conqueror’s Sea, reportedly awoke early yesterday 
morning to shouts and the scent of smoke. The fire originated at Andras’
 Council House at the bluff’s edge and quickly began to spread—luckily, 
the House was empty in the dead of night and no lives were lost. The 
source of the fire remains unknown, though the first villager on the 
scene offered this report: “The flames came up from down the bluff 
before the Council House caught fire. When I looked over the edge, there
 was something—or someone—down there, engulfed in flame! I hardly got a 
good look at him before he disappeared in a blaze down the shoreline.” 
This sighting has not been otherwise confirmed. </p>
<p>Settlers who fought back the fire also reported its frightening 
resistance to efforts to quell it. “The fire spread faster than any 
natural fire I’ve ever seen,” said one wary councilwoman. “It wanted to 
consume everything in its path. There’s magic at work here.” </p>
</div>
</div>
<div align="justify">
<div class="right_column" style="margin-top: 3px;">
<p>As the Institute of War received reports of similar instances in 
neighboring coastal settlements over the following days, League 
representatives responded to detection of a high amount of magical 
energy in the same region. League Representative Mycroft Zimmer and a 
small group of summoners arrived in Andras and spread along the other 
coastal settlements to provide a close monitoring of the situation as it
 develops. </p> 
<p> “The Institute of War has reason to believe that the culprit behind 
these fires is utilizing unauthorized magic,” Zimmer stated. “While we 
do not yet know what we are facing, the Institute of War does not 
tolerate reckless use of power. If this is the work of a rogue mage, the
 perpetrator will be dealt with appropriately.” </p>
<p>The fires follow a strange and sudden increase in coastal 
temperatures measured over the past few days. While wildfires and odd 
weather aren’t entirely unheard of in the region, even along the coast, 
most instances occur during the dry months and remain isolated to the 
Great Barrier forests. </p>
<p>Not all of the Institute’s representatives share Zimmer’s conviction,
 however. “It’s strange, but not unusual,” said Runaan Eversky, a 
summoner under Zimmer’s watch. “We must be careful, but it could be 
anything. We’ve had strange magical weather before. This is Runeterra, 
after all.”</p>

<h1>The Horseshoe Heist</h1>
<h2>Bandle City horses discovered short a shoe</h2>
<div align="justify">
<div class="article_block_50 left">
<div class="reporter_box"><span class="reported_by"> Quinton Groat </span> <span class="reported_from"> reporting from Bandle City</span></div><img class="inline_image" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;" src="./JOJ TEMPLATE_files/portrait_Quinton1.jpg" alt="">

<p>Sunday morning, Bandle City horse owners were alarmed to discover 
that several of their horses were inexplicably missing horseshoes.  
Residents became aware of the issue when Bampo Tunker, a local stable 
owner, reached out to nearby farm owners for information about the 
suspected theft or prank.  Hours later, a joint investigation conducted 
by Bandle City authorities and the Mothership Equine Society revealed 
that nearly every horse in the region suddenly lacked its left-front 
horseshoe.  Locals are calling it the “Horseshoe Heist”.</p>
<p> “It’s the darnedest thing,” Tunker commented, “I noticed one of my 
stock was missing a shoe first thing in the morning.  That kind of thing
 happens all the time so I replaced it without a thought.  I rode out 
with Fripple, one of my hands, for our morning rounds, and Ol’ Breesa 
got spooked and threw me!  First time ever!  I looked back to Fripple 
and his horse was spooked, and he was layin’ in the mud right behind 
me!” </p>
<p>Experts are puzzled, to say the least.  “This is perplexing,” 
confessed Dalilah Frommin, spokesyordle for the Equine Society.  “It 
would take an awful lot of effort to remove a shoe from so many horses 
in one night, let alone without anyone noticing.  And why?  Horseshoes 
generally they aren’t that valuable.  And if you were going to steal 
them for profit…well, I’d think you’d want to take all four.” </p>

</div>
</div>
<div align="justify">
<div class="right_column" style="margin-top: 3px;">
<p>For most horse owners, the oddness of the situation has preempted 
their frustrations.  Tunker chose to take it as motivation.  “Well, at 
first I was pretty riled up, but when I thought about it, enough of the 
herd was overdue for a new set that this might just have been a 
much-needed kick in the pants.”  
</p><p>Estimated losses were low, but Mayor Dennison Jadefellow 
organized an outdoor charity banquet to raise funds for Horseshoe Heist 
victims.  The banquet was a smash success, as hundreds of Bandle City 
residents, including League champions Teemo and Tristana, came out to 
support local horse owners and discuss the peculiar occasion. </p>
<p>Officials reported that they actually received quite a bit more in 
donations than was necessary to replace the horseshoes, and they are 
currently deliberating how to invest the additional funds.  They are 
also considering making the “Horseshoe Banquet” a regular annual event 
as, in the end, it has been viewed as a great source of amusement. </p>
<p>Jadefellow commented, “Whoever the mastermind behind this evil was, he has a lot new fans in Bandle City.” </p>

<h1>The Mailbag of Justice</h1>
<h2>Reader mail from all across Valoran - answered!</h2>

<div class="reporter_box"><span class="reported_by"> Senior Summoner Ralston Farnsley </span> <span class="reported_from"> commenting from the Institute of War </span></div><img class="inline_image" style="width: 75px; height: 75px;" src="./JOJ TEMPLATE_files/portrait_Ralston1.jpg" alt="">

<p>The recent addition of the Blind Monk to the League is inspiring.  
His level of commitment and dedication to the betterment of the world is
 something we should all aspire to.  I salute him, and look forward to 
seeing the impact he can have as a champion of the League of Legends. </p>

<p><i>“I pen my question to you in response to a recent letter in the 
Journal. In your response to "Where can I summon my champions from?" The
 Journal stated: "...summoning creatures or people from other planets or
 against their will is expressly forbidden, except in some very special 
circumstances approved by the League."</i></p>

<p><i>“So the League has the right to pull a creature from its world 
against its will?  How can we trust a League that is up for kidnapping, 
special circumstances or not.” </i> – <b>Summoner Mizuki</b></p>

<p>Your question is well-received.  It is the duty of all citizens to 
ask questions like these of their governments and leaders in order to 
keep the powers in check.  I think one of the major reasons this is in 
the forefront of some minds is because of the recent induction of 
Nocturne to the League.  A confessed (and proud) murderer of summoners, 
there was quite a bit of controversy surrounding what to do with him 
when he emerged and was captured in our world. </p>

<p>There was a particularly fierce debate over whether he should be 
exterminated immediately for his crimes and to prevent further threat, 
or whether he should be kept alive and examined in order to better 
understand the dream plane.  After great deliberation, it was decided 
that he should pay for his crimes on the Fields of Justice.  The League 
pledged the wealth which would normally be accorded to him as a champion
 instead to the families of his victims.  He will literally pay.  At the
 same time, he will be neither executed nor made a lab rat.  Regardless 
of which decision you agree with, they did put some consideration into 
the issue.  I have to admit, I agree with their decision.  </p>

<p> <i> “I have a question about the remaining two survivors that made 
it back with Jarvan IV from their great two year journey, who are they? 
What shape are they in now after this adventure?” </i> – <b>lil westy</b></p>

<p>The two soldiers who returned with Jarvan never uttered a word about 
the journey.  It is unknown how much information has even been disclosed
 to the Royal Family, as rumor has it that Jarvan himself hasn’t spoken 
of the trip with even his closest friends.  I managed to discover that 
one of the men was granted “indefinite leave” and currently resides at 
Demacia’s Fairweather Retreat, a resort well-known for aiding soldiers 
plagued by the trauma of battle.  The other soldier seems to have 
completely vanished. </p>

<hr class="half">

<p> <i> “Question for Cassiopeia: Since your introduction to the League,
 you have, in my opinion, been one of the best and most underrated 
champions available for summoning. I am confused as to why you haven't 
had any attention since your initiation, and what you have been keeping 
yourself busy with since?” </i> – <b>Summoner AngryPeanut</b></p>

<p>As someone who knew Cassiopeia before and after the…incident, I have 
to say it saddens me deeply (and unsettles me thoroughly) to see her 
slithering down the corridors of the Institute.  Don’t let it be said 
that I don’t go the extra mile for you, our readers. </p>

<p> “Why haven’t I had attention?!  You are more cruel than angry, 
Peanut.  In case you haven’t noticed, I am not exactly the flower I once
 was.  I appreciate your summons, and am pleased to have served you 
well, but my life will forever more be one of reclusion.  If you 
suddenly woke to find yourself molting, you might understand.  As for 
how I “keep myself busy,” I spend my ample free time looking into the 
sudden and mysterious disappearance of a loved one, and the promise of 
vengeance when I discover those responsible."</p>
